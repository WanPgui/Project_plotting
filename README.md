Project_plotting assignment

Overview
This assignment focuses on analyzing transport-related data with an emphasis on vehicles and fuel efficiency. The analysis is part of the ASC23 initiative, which considers various systems-based tracks including cities, urban and rural settlements, infrastructure, and transport. This work will contribute to informing the global stocktake on transport.

Objectives
Analyze transport data to gain insights into vehicle and fuel efficiency.
Use visualization tools to interpret relationships between data features.
Prepare diagrams for further AI analysis.
Dataset
The dataset provided for this assignment contains information on vehicles and fuel efficiency. Download the dataset and starter notebook from the provided links and upload them to your own drive.

Steps
Access and Setup

Download the starter notebook and dataset from the provided links.
Upload both files to your own drive.
Library Imports

Import the necessary libraries, including at least pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and numpy.
python

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
Data Loading and Display

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Display a few rows (between 4 and 10) to understand the structure of the data.
python

data = pd.read_csv('fuel_econ.csv')
data.head(6)
Data Visualization

Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a specific feature (e.g., fuel efficiency).
Create a heatmap to show the correlation between different features.
python

# Plot a histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['fuel_efficiency'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Fuel Efficiency')
plt.xlabel('Fuel Efficiency')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.savefig('histogram.png')
plt.show()

# Plot a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.savefig('heatmap.png')
plt.show()
Interpretation

Interpret the created diagrams and explain the insights gained from them.
Provide interpretations in the notebook as comments or text cells.
Export and Submission

Export the diagrams as PNG files and place them in a folder.
Export the Jupyter notebook with all code, outputs, and interpretations included.
Submission

Submit the GitHub link to your notebook. Ensure that all outputs are visible and that the notebook is complete.
